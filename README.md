# Cryptocurrency Performance Clustering: Visualizing Time-based Performance

This project is a prototype for assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies, taking into account factors beyond just returns and volatility. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques and financial Python programming skills, we will cluster cryptocurrencies based on their performance in different time periods. We can then visually analyze the results.
